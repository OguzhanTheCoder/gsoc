Project proposal
Synopsis
 This project integrates SpikeInterface's motion correction into the spikewrap package. Electrophysiological recordings often suffer from mechanical drift, affecting the accuracy of spike sorting, particularly with Neuropixels probes. By implementing drift correction directly within spikewrap, this project simplifies and accelerates the preprocessing workflow. Goals include seamless integration, thorough testing, and clear documentation. Deliverables are: integration of motion correction functionality, complete tests, and documentation/examples. This enhancement benefits the open-source neuroscience community by making sophisticated preprocessing accessible, significantly improving neural data quality.
Implementation timeline

 Week 1: Initial integration prototype; basic drift correction working.
 Week 2: Debugging, optimization; finalize core functionality.
 Week 3: Implement comprehensive unit tests (50% coverage).
 Week 4: Expand tests (75% coverage); start drafting documentation.
 Week 5: Complete tests (100%); refine user documentation/examples.
 Week 6: Mid-term checkpoint; submit functional prototype for review.
 Week 7: Incorporate feedback; begin stretch goal implementation (preset benchmarking).
 Week 8: Benchmark drift presets; performance comparisons documented.
 Week 9: Stretch goal refinement; start GUI integration if time permits.
 Week 10: Complete GUI prototype; documentation updates.
 Week 11: Code freeze; thorough debugging, final documentation.
 Week 12: Final tests, documentation revisions, submission preparation.
Communication plan:
 Weekly video calls, daily Zulip chat updates, regular GitHub pull request discussions.
Personal statement
Past experience:
 I hold a B.Sc. in Psychology from Radboud University and am completing my M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, focusing on machine learning, signal processing, and robotics. Professionally, I worked as a software developer at Construktiv GmbH, developing software solutions in Python and C++. My portfolio includes significant experience in electrophysiological signal processing (EEG), machine learning applications (Deep Learning with PyTorch and TensorFlow), robotics (ROS, Gazebo, TurtleBot navigation), and reinforcement learning algorithms (NEAT, Monte-Carlo methods). Notable projects include neuroevolution for robotic control, EEG-based mood prediction using LSTM networks, and AI chatbot development using OpenAI APIs.
Motivation: why this project?
 This project aligns closely with my passion for neuroscience and artificial intelligence, specifically in decoding neural signals to drive sophisticated applications like prosthetic control and robotics. I'm motivated by the potential real-world impact of accurately interpreting electrophysiological signals, enhancing prosthetic functionality, and improving quality of life. Contributing to an open-source electrophysiological tool such as SpikeInterface directly complements my professional trajectory toward a PhD and further research in neuroprosthetics and BCI.
Match: why you?
I offer a strong interdisciplinary background combining psychology, neuroscience, and advanced artificial intelligence. My hands-on experience with Python, electrophysiological data analysis, machine learning frameworks, and robotics simulations uniquely positions me to contribute effectively to this project. Additionally, my practical skills in signal processing and prior development with ROS and neuroevolution algorithms provide a robust foundation to successfully implement motion correction functionalities in spikewrap.
Availability:
I am fully available during the entire GSoC period without conflicting commitments, ensuring dedicated attention and timely completion of the project.
GSoC experience:
From GSoC, I expect structured mentorship, exposure to a vibrant community, and the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to impactful open-source software. This experience will significantly enhance my expertise and support my future academic and professional goals.
Are you also applying to projects with other organisations in GSoC 2025?
No, I am exclusively applying to NIU for GSoC 2025.
